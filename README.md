fay_wysiwyg
===========

Currently, for my work, I am forced to maintain a really hackey, very not-good HTML WYSIWYG.  

This is an attempt to make a modular, fast web wysiwyg, but allowing for the elegance and safety a language like Haskell gives you. 

This is licensed under the public domain, as I imagine most of what I'm going to do here isn't going to be big enough to copyright.
